                Current Dream
            </h2>
            <p>I strive for financial stability and to be recognized as a top artist in my field. I am attending school at the moment to become a Data Analyst. I hope that this can help regulate my schedule to allow me to do the other things I find important in my life.</p>

                Happiness and Regret
            </h2>
            <p>Learning and solving problems makes me happy. My biggest regret is not attending MIT.I had financial troubles and could not afford to attend. Being accepted was an accomplishment in itself but I feel I cheated myself out of a good opportunity by not finding a way to go. </p>
